# Minesweeper
__MVP__:Having the board load with a set amount of bombs and random placement throughout the board. When you press a square it will reveal either a bomb or a number with the number of bombs surrounding that tile.

Specs:
* A display telling you how many more bombs are left.

* A timer that tells you how long you've spent on the game.

* If you click a bomb them all the bombs on the board are revealed

* Something that tells you when you won.

* A flag button that lets you flag what you think are bombs.

* Making a board that is x # of tiles wide and x # of tiles in height. (the bombs would have to keep the same proportions if I do this).
